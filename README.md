Provisioning Azure Resources with Python
This repository contains a Python script that leverages the Azure SDK to automate the provisioning of Azure resources. The script is designed to create a complete virtual machine infrastructure in Azure, including resource groups, virtual networks, subnets, network interfaces, and virtual machines.

Purpose
The purpose of this script is to simplify the process of setting up Azure infrastructure for virtual machines, making it more efficient and reproducible. It is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to deploy a standardized infrastructure for development, testing, or production environments.

Features
Resource Group Creation: Automatically creates an Azure resource group for organizing resources.

Virtual Network and Subnet Provisioning: Sets up a virtual network with a specified address space and a subnet within it.

Network Interface: Creates a network interface client with a private IP configuration and associates it with the subnet.

SSH Key Pair Generation: Generates an SSH key pair for secure access to the virtual machine.

Virtual Machine Deployment: Deploys an Azure virtual machine with a customizable configuration, including the operating system, VM size, and SSH public key for authentication.

Getting Started
To use this script, follow these steps:

Ensure you have the Azure CLI and Azure SDK for Python installed.

Set the AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID environment variable to your Azure subscription ID.

Customize the script by adjusting parameters such as resource group name, location, and virtual machine configuration as needed.

Execute the script to provision the Azure resources.

Important Notes
This script provides a basic infrastructure setup. You can extend and customize it to meet specific requirements.

Make sure you have the necessary Azure permissions and have logged in using the Azure CLI before running the script.
